Gshortener is IM bot writen in Python that can be running on the Google App Engine.

The gshortener IM bot can turn a long URL into a much shorter one. Just add <gshortener@appspot.com> to your GoogleTalk or any other XMPP/Jabber IM buddy list, and send it a message with original URL only for short. When you added it you can open the chat and type /help for more information.
